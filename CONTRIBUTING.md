## Editing the API or GUI

Please make a fork and open a pull request on this repository.

Keep in mind that my code is pretty messy, and you may have
a hard time reading it :)

## Writing Add-ons

If you would like to learn how to write an add-on, please read
the [API documentation][api-docs]. Then, you can write your add-on
in your own repository.

There is currently no official add-on distribution website, but
if I ever create one, **I will most likely only accept GNU General**
**Public License v3 compatible licenses**
